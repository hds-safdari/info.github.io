I am an interdisciplinary physicist, specialized in statistical physics, complex networks, and computational modeling. I am deeply interested in understanding the complexity and intricacies of real systems —- particularly those found in social networks and in nature —- by constructing novel probabilistic generative models. I have a comprehensive knowledge of machine learning techniques, including Bayesian inference and deep learning. I hope to shed light on the hidden interactions within these systems, contributing to fields as diverse as anomaly detection, community detection, and strategic decision-making. I have extensive experience in collaborating with scientists with diverse expertise and find such interdisciplinary collaborations tremendously rewarding, especially since they open the door to using my theoretical and computational skills to answer complex questions of profound real/world importance. 


 <!-- My research revolves around creating probabilistic generative models to understand the intricate structures and dynamics of real-world systems, particularly in social networks and biological processes. With a deep understanding of machine learning techniques, including Bayesian inference and deep learning, I develop advanced models to analyze and predict patterns in complex datasets. My work aims to decode the hidden interactions within these systems, contributing to fields such as anomaly detection, community detection, and strategic decision-making. Passionate about collaboration and scientific innovation, I strive to leverage my theoretical and computational expertise to advance our understanding of complex phenomena. -->
